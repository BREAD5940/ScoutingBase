NOTES:

Qualifier number     |  Note
              21     | pretty solid, used meccanum wheels on drivetrains, were able to almost compete rocket by themselves with minimal help. drives slow but cycles are optimized. honestly a solid pick.
              81     | only focused on cargo. played a little defense. smooth ride
               7     | they did okay. they were taking their time getting around the field, but you could tell that they were carrying their alliance. the other teams sucked. their climb was smooth, however they are close to then edge of the platform so there is a possibility they may fall back. 
              13     | fucked up their climb real bad. looks like they parked backward or something. pretty OK overall, they look like they have swerve(plez double check that thanks) 
              64     | Very good hatch & ball intake, just needs a bit more skillful driving and maybe speed to get themselves a solo rocket.
              71     | 
              51     | uhhh pretty sick team actually even tho their elevator is a tad slow 
              41     | the robot worked well and real smooth.interesting intake for cargo it was like a box
