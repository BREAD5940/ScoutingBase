NOTES:

Qualifier number     |  Note
              11     | preloaded cargo
moving very slowly
kind of played defense majority of match
no mech
ramp but did not use
drive made it hard to align 
              50     | Wasn't paying attention to the other not much. Was looking at our not getting smashed ;(
              64     | r a m p  b o t, intake shaky enough to cause problems ( probably going to break) , also had issues with placing. intake for cargo can miss. average speed. driver is good at aligning. dropped ramps but alliance member couldn't go on. as good as this robotcan possibly be.
              27     | ramp bot. 
defense pinned by counter defence too light 
              70     | they are OK at driving and pretty solid at cargo. only did cargo ship, they are a ramp bot but didn't use the ramp
               1     | intake is not really working just keeps dropping things then tried to play counter defense and failed !bleh driving!  *technically* didn't drop any more but lost a bunch from human player station when trying to intake.
they are marked as having an rp for complete rocket but that rocket was NOT completed so idk what that was
               2     | ramp bot- got 5419 to level 3. foul for crossing line during sandstorm. played defense badly too light 1rp for hab
              43     | played some defence. was bucking a lot. was annoying as a defender but not amazing. was a ramp bot, but didn't work that well and instead no one got a hab bonus because the other robot couldn't get up the ramp. possibly got a tech foul
              32     | its pretty slow
