              27     | ramp bot. 
defense pinned by counter defence too light 
              13     | fucked up their climb real bad. looks like they parked backward or something. pretty OK overall, they look like they have swerve(plez double check that thanks) 
              20     | the light was blinking but it just didn't drive. 
              23     | slow cycle times, yeeted onto lv2
              80     | played defense
              34     | first of all, their drivetrain is jerky their hatch mech is literal ass, they can't drive, their elevator control is janky, they can't align hatches properly and they are team 100. do not pick under any circumstance. this post was sponsored by the ex-team 100 gang.
              46     | we don't like team 100 ðŸ˜¸

              60     | speedy hab climb. team 100 honestly has a really bad intake. if only there was some way to improve it, some sort of attachable device that improves the intake mechanism, possibly named after a cake dessert.  if only if only. 
              63     | wood bot. not a bad cargo not, compared to some others. kinda slow getting cargo from loading station- dropped a few and can't pick up from floor
