NOTES:

Qualifier number     |  Note
              41     | not great.
              78     | defense for entire match. blocked greybots from rocket for entire match. valkiant effort, but still somewhat useless. if they were faster would have been able to shut out half the opponents field. driver is a gamer. might notbhave used/had cam.
              59     | didn't preload. played  "defense" otherwise known as driving back and forth on a line. knocked hatch out on opponents side. average speed. 
               1     | intake is not really working just keeps dropping things then tried to play counter defense and failed !bleh driving!  *technically* didn't drop any more but lost a bunch from human player station when trying to intake.
              25     | their hatch mech is a pincher and their cargo mech is a couple panels to hold a ball coupled with a piston to push it out....nuff said
              65     | only moves forward in auto... driver seems like they got 2 hours of sleep and are hungover
              31     | they are mediocre. they got carried by their other teammates. 
              87     | defense/counter defense seemed to be keeping robots away from madtown
