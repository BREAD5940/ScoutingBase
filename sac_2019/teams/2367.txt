NOTES:

Qualifier number     |  Note
               9     | driver is a bit aggressive, robot is fast, after they loaded cargo ship they didn't do much
              77     | has good speed. operator has absolutley no clue what their robot does. spent the game chasing 1 cargo. if operator knew what they were doing, would be pretty good. elevator OK, but the mech for cargo has 3 steps.
              21     | they played really good defense. the alliance got 6 penalties and I tink it was because of this robot since they played defense. 
              36     | defense. confusing strategy.
              65     | the robot is good with cargo but the driver is bad. could only do cargo ship
              15     | bad driver in sandstorm that slammed into cargo pile. having trouble picking up cargo. right side of drivetrain not moving correctly BC something broke part way through 
              83     | filled half of ship but then went to get another piece of cargo and then couldn't controlled and kept spinning
              45     | fell trying to get on to lvl 2 HAB. the placement of the cargo was too hard. It kept going over the opening.
              50     | they placed one piece during sand storm but then played heavy defense for the rest of the match
